# MIPSLAB

Computer orgnization courseworks in XJTU.

By Junyang Zhang.

## Simulation

The project has a testbench also written in Verilog HDL, thus using any simulator other than [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/) would be suffice. It is recommended to use [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) as a simulator, and other platforms such as [Modelsim](https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/ic/modelsim/), [Vivado](https://china.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html), [Quartus](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/download.html) are yet to be tested.

### Installing Icarus Verilog

It is recommended to work with Linux or Unix-like systems. If you wish to install Icarus Verilog in Windows (without WSL), please do some research.

In MacOS: ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))

```sh
brew install iverilog
```

In Debian based distributions: ([apt-get](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-handbook/sect.apt-get.zh-cn.html))

```sh
sudo apt-get iverilog
```

### Running simulation

First, clone this repository and `cd` into it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/James-Hen/MIPSLAB.git
cd MIPSLAB
```

I wrote a handy make script to simulate and generate waveforms.

```sh
make
```

Then the vvp files and waveforms of all targets will be generated in `target/`. Read the waveform with [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/), [WaveTrace](https://www.wavetrace.io/), etc.

The target can be selected to build such as `make single_cycle`, `make multicycle`, `make pipeline`.

## Testing

Currently, no auto testing scripts of MIPS ISA are deployed. But anyone could run the processor with their self-written assembly language text and data, generated by [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/). Please assemble the `.asm` files and load the `.text` segment into `sim/imem.text`, and `.data` segment into `sim/dmem.data`, as hexadecimal text files. The simulatior will read those files and load them into the debug memories.

Some handy assembly programs are given in `sim/MIPS_sample_src`.
